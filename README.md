# 🎢 Roller Coaster Data Analysis (EDA with Pandas)

📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on roller coaster data using pandas, seaborn, and numpy. The dataset coaster_db.csv contains various details about roller coasters, such as speed, height, inversions, and locations. The analysis aims to clean, explore, and visualize key insights from the data.

🛠️ Steps in the Notebook
Importing Libraries – Load necessary libraries (pandas, seaborn, numpy).
Reading the Dataset – Load coaster_db.csv into a pandas DataFrame.
Initial Exploration – Inspect data shape, column names, and descriptive statistics.
Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generate visualizations and insights using Seaborn.
Feature Engineering (if applicable) – Create new features for better insights.
Conclusion – Summarize key takeaways from the analysis.

📊 Visualization & Insights
This project includes various visualizations, such as:
Pair plots to analyze relationships between numeric features.
Bar plots for average speed by location.
Histograms for distribution of height and inversions.
